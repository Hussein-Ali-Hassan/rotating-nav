        <p>
          Calisthenics (American English) or callisthenics (British English) is
          a form of strength training consisting of a variety of movements that
          exercise large muscle groups (gross motor movements), such as
          standing, grasping, pushing, etc. These exercises are often performed
          rhythmically and with minimal equipment, as bodyweight exercises. They
          are intended to increase strength, fitness, and flexibility, through
          movements such as pulling, pushing, bending, jumping, or swinging,
          using one's body weight for resistance. Calisthenics can provide the
          benefits of muscular and aerobic conditioning, in addition to
          improving psychomotor skills such as balance, agility, and
          coordination.

        <h3>Human Flag</h3>

        <p>
          The human flag or bar hold is a feat of strength where the body is
          parallel to the ground supported by a vertical bar. A straight line is
          formed using the arms and body. The trick requires the performer to
          have extensive upper body strength.

          The bottom arm is usually turned to grip the pole and is straight to
          "push" the body up. The top arm faces forward and grips on the pole.
          This arm "pulls" the body to maintain a parallel position to the
          ground. Easier variations include hooking one arm over the pole or by
          having the legs straddled, tucked or raised. Learning the hold is
          generally done by starting with the legs parallel to the pole and then
          slowly lowering them to the ground. Tucking or straddling the legs
          alleviates pressure on the abdomen, also making the move much easier
          to hold.
